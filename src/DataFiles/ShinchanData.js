      "He is 5 years old and yet acts overly mature. He knows the adults' words (does not always fully understand the meaning though), and hints at his somewhat deep philosophy in between dumb behavior. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which Shinnosuke's own crazy antics actually solved the problems of those around him. Whether this is the result of his own or purely accidental is debatable. Adding to that, he also displays a surprising amount of talent and ability in various activities (running, surfing, kendo, fishing, skiing, swimming and others).",

      "Mitsy Nohara in the Vitello, Phuuz, Funimation and Dutch dubs, is the mother of the Nohara family, and its caretaker. She is 29 years old but she always tells people that she is 24 or 25. She is the classical housewife of post-war Japan - she cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers, and lazes all to varying degrees of success. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children (mainly Shinnosuke), she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight and has even been known to display double standards while in their company.",

While he is the family breadwinner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. He is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take-home pay to his wife every month. He is a quiet, reasonable person who is almost always invited by his boss or a worker to drink beers - where he almost always gets drunk.",

He has an affiliation for anime and manga girls especially magical girls such as Magical Girl Moe-P, she loves many girl like Ai, Midori, Hanako, Torma and many other girls and he felt mad in love with ai and asked if she will marry her and than he is been tightly slapped by aA. hough he tries to hide this fact from his friends.

      "She loves to play 'real omamagoto' ('real house') in which divorces and arguments are very common and she typically forces/blackmails the boys to play with her. She insists on being the mom all the time-and she forces her friends to do stuff they don't really want to do. This is always a nuisance to Shin-chan, Bo-chan, and Kazama-kun and a nightmare to Masao as he often needs to be Nene's husband (as an unsuccessful salaryman) in the plot. She occasionally sees her mother go crazy or do something out of character which shrieks Nene to say something literally translated to be 'you're not my usual mom!",

      "His nickname is 'Onigiri' due to his shaven head's resemblance to a rice ball and there are several moments where Shin-chan accidentally mistook Masao's gray colored head for a rice ball and even tried to eat it. His friends use the nickname as a term of endearment, while the people that bully him use it as a put-down. Shinchan and Nene often calls him 'Onigiri'. Shin is one of his great friends, but his thoughtless words often put down Masao and makes him cry. Shinchan and Nene bully him sometimes (not in a bad way) for example when Masao showed his friends he had a four leaf clover that turns out to bring him luck multiple times, Shinchan and Nene fight for it and the leaves torn apart making Masao cry.",
